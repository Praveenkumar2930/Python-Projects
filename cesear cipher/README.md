Caesar Cipher Program

This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.



## Features

Encryption: Convert plaintext to ciphertext by shifting characters.

Decryption: Convert ciphertext back to plaintext using the same shift value.

Custom Shift: User-defined shift values for encryption and decryption.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

## Usage
Run the program:
python caesar_cipher.py

## Program Structure

caesar_cipher.py

This is the main script that contains the implementation of the Caesar Cipher.

Functions

encrypt(text, shift): Encrypts the input text by shifting characters by shift positions.

decrypt(text, shift): Decrypts the input text by reversing the shift.

shift_character(char, shift): Helper function to shift a single character.
## Running the Program
When you run the caesar_cipher.py script, you will be prompted to enter the plaintext, the shift value, and whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the text.
